# how to run this project

We'll have two databases in this project. One for real looking dev data and another for simpler test data.

You will need to create two .env files for your project: .env.test and .env.development. Into each, add
`PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>`, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names).

You'll need to run npm install at this point.
